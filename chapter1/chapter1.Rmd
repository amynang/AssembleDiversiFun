abstract: Species-rich communities have shown increased ecosystem functioning, such as higher primary productivity. This positive relationship between diversity and functioning tends to become steeper over time. One mechanism proposed to explain this change is the reduction of niche overlap and therefore competition within producers and consumers. Here, combining a food-web assembly model with a bio-energetic model of community dynamics, we examine how niche differentiation in consumer and producer communities affects the plant diversity-productivity relationship. Drawing species from a regional pool, we constructed communities that varied in plant richness and niche overlap among species, i.e. unrestricted or restricted linkage similarity among consumers, crossed with high or low interspecific competition among plants. Simulating community dynamics, we examine how the different scenarios modify the plant diversity-productivity relationship. We demonstrate that low intraspecific competition among producers is critical for increased niche complementarity of consumers or producers to have a positive effect on the diversity-productivity relationship.

### Introduction

An ecosystem's ability to function, resist disturbances and provide services to
humans depends on its biodiversity [citation]. Additionally, research in the
last decades has indicated that this positive diversity - functioning
relationship tends to establish and become stronger over time [@cardinale2007;
@meyer2016]. Therefore, it may be weak [@reich2012] or absent [@strecker2016]
among communities in the first few years of their establishment, and become
considerably stronger in later years [@huang2018]. One implication is that newly
restored communities may require considerable time to achieve a level of
functioning comparable to old natural communities [@moreno-mateos2020;
@resch2021]. Understanding the mechanisms that are involved in the establishment
of the diversity - ecosystem functioning relationship is thus crucial for the
effective management of ecosystems, as they can tip the scales in conservation
versus restoration decisions.

Competition for resources such as light or nutrients is instrumental in
understanding the changes of the plant community functioning over time. The
strength of competition is often characterized by niche overlap (strong
competition) versus complementarity (weak competition) in the distribution of
individuals across a conceptual niche axis. Plant species grown in diverse plant
communities (mixtures) have been shown to become morphologically more dissimilar
than the same species when grown in monocultures [@zuppinger-dingley2014]. This
suggests that interspecific competition leads to shifts along the niche axis to
reduce niche overlap among species, making them more complementary in their use
of resources. However, intraspecific trait variability also allows individuals
to escape competition from conspecifics [@jung2010]. The implication is that
avoiding interspecific competition by shifts along the niche axis to achieve
complementarity can come at a cost for productivity, if it can only be
accomplished by individuals of the same species becoming more concentrated in
the same area of niche space. We would therefore argue that for niche
differentiation to have a net positive effect on productivity, it must be
effected in a way that allows species to lower interspecific competition (i.e.
by moving away from each other on the niche axis), while at the same time
maintaining tolerable levels of intraspecific competition. This in turn requires
that species shift their location in niche space while maintaining relatively
high dispersion of the individuals' niche positions. Despite empirical evidence
that plant populations shift in their traits over time (REFs) and thus change
the niche spectrum they occupy, it is far from clear how these dynamic changes
affect their diversity-productivity relationship.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of multi-trophic interactions in
our understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem
functioning [@seibold2018; @barnes2020; @albert2022]. This has expanded the
focus of the field from primary productivity to functions performed by the
consumer community [@poisot2013; @barnes2020; @maureaud2020] and the
multi-trophic control of plant diversity and productivity [@schneider2016;
@wang2018]. This multi-trophic perspective is equally relevant in our effort to
understand how community assembly across trophic levels can reshape this
relationship over time. Active dispersal makes it easy for regional consumers to
colonize a location, as long as they can find resources there [@gravel2011;
@bauer2022], but after the early pioneer phase the food-web they comprise will
also be structured by competitive exclusion. Specifically, strong competitors
can extirpate species that occupy a similar niche, while new species can succeed
in invading the community only if they are sufficiently unique to avoid
competition by existing species [@hui2021]. In this sense, species' trophic
links are an important manifestation of their realized niche; species that share
resources will experience high exploitative competition while species that share
consumers are subject to apparent competition [@holt1977; @stouffer2010;
@holt2017a]. The expected effect of time is therefore to restructure the animal
community in a way that increases trophic complementarity [@poisot2013;
@bauer2022], with potential cascading effects to the plant community. However,
the effects of such multitrophic restructuring during community assembly
processes on the strength of the relationship between plant diversity and
primary productivity have remained virtually unexplored.

~~Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to [original way of
saying it again] in plant-rich communities. In the case of primary productivity,
these include increased facilitation by beneficial microbes [?], increased
resource complementary through reduced niche overlap among plants
[@zuppinger-dingley2014] or animals [].~~

As these different mechanisms of plant and animal competition are likely to act
in concert, discerning their individual contribution to the observed patterns in
plant diversity-productivity relationships can be challenging. In particular,
experimental manipulations of plant niches and animal interactions in the field
are extremely challenging at best. Therefore, in silico biodiversity experiments
are useful as they allow us to investigate the expected effects of community
assembly on the niche overlap of plants and animals separately. By excluding
other potentially confounding factors they provide the means to examine how
niche shifts of the animal and plant communities during assembly modify the
diversity-function relationship . Here, we use such an in silico approach and
investigate the potential for niche differentiation over time, in both plant and
animal communities, to modify the relationship between plant diversity and three
key ecosystem functions: primary productivity, herbivory pressure on plants, and
herbivore control by predators. ~~Our results confirm that the relative changes
of intra- and interspecific competition in plants can determine whether the
diversity-functioning relationship will strengthen or weaken over time, while
the effects of increased complementarity among animals can be highly variable,
yet positive on average.~~

### Methods

![Conseptual figure](images/concept.png)

![Concept figure. (a) A regional pool of species and their potential
interactions, featuring allometric predatory and nested herbivorous
interactions. (b) Local communities of a varying number of plants and a fixed
number of animals produced by sampling from the regional pool. (c) Plant species
in communities without history can have high niche overlap and therefore high
inter-specific competition. Over time they can respond either by restricting
their niche to avoid other species but increasing competition with
con-specifics, or spread out in niche space so that overall competition
decreases. (d) Animal competition is reduced by iteratively replacing species
with others from the regional pool such that linkage similarity is reduced,
simulating the effects of competitive exclusion. Starting from animal
communities with unrestricted link similarity (left), we get animal communities
with restricted similarity (right). Animals are represented by circles red hues,
plants by circles in green hues.](images/Concept2.png)

#### Regional species pool

We generated a regional species pool of 1000 species (250 each of plants,
herbivores, omnivores, predators). Species' body-masses (in grams) where defined
as $10^x$, where $x$ is sampled with a uniform distribution in [-9, 3] to
represent terrestrial organisms from nematodes to small mammals. We arranged
herbivorous interactions, including herbivory by omnivores, to have a nested
pattern with some plants consumed by most plant consumers, while others by only
few and some plant consumers consuming most plant species while others only few
of them [@thebault2010]. Plant consumers were randomly selected across the body
size range, then omnivores were sampled from plant consumers with a probability
that depends on the fraction out of all plants that a species consumes (so
herbivores are more likely than omnivores to be specialists). Predatory
interactions are allometric, adapted from @schneider2016. The feeding niche of
each animal species was defined as the body mass interval at which the ricker
function used in @schneider2016 returns values larger than a threshold $\theta$:

$$
M_{ij} = \begin{cases} 
1,\quad if \quad 
\left( \frac{m_j}{m_iR_{opt}}e^{1-\frac{m_j}{m_iR_{opt}}}\right)^\gamma > \theta. 
\\ 0, \quad otherwise. \end{cases}
$$

where $m_j$ is the mass of the predator, $m_i$ that of the prey and $R_{opt}$ is
the optimal predator-prey mass ratio which we set to 0.6 on the log scale,
typical of terrestrial invertebrates [@brose2006]. To produce a food web for
which allometry does not entirely determine consumption (i.e. non-interval food
web [@cattin2004]), the resulting interaction matrix was thinned by randomly
removing 30% of the produced interactions.

#### Local communities

Local communities of 2 to 16 plant species and 40 animal species (300 replicates
for each plant diversity increment) are produced by randomly sampling the
regional species pool, while ensuring that all species have at least one
resource in the local community (following @bauer2022). The produced food-webs
represent communities "without history", where species occurrence is most
contingent on the presence of their resources.

###### **Animal linkage similarity**

For each one of the communities described above, we produced an alternative
community "with history" by removing animal species with a probability that
depends on their linkage similarity to other local species (operating as a proxy
of niche overlap) and replacing them with species from the regional pool. This
proceeds iteratively, with the use of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, so that
eventually we arrive at a community composition of reduced similarity among the
local species [@bauer2022], representative of communities structured by history,
where competitive exclusion is also ~~at play~~ in action.

The local communities were generated by sampling from the regional pool using
the *assembly* package [citation].

###### **Plant competition**

To simulate the effects of niche differentiation on plants, we directly
manipulated the plant-plant interaction matrix (see next section), representing
plant competition for nutrients. For each local community, we first generated a
plant competition matrix that corresponds to high niche overlap among species
i.e. the competition that each species experiences from all other species can be
as high as the competition from con-specifics (fig.). Then we generated a
competition matrix that corresponds to reduced niche overlap but without a niche
shift, i.e inter-specific competition is reduced but intra-specific competition
increases, such that the overall competition remains the same. Finally, we
generated a competition matrix that corresponds to reduced niche overlap
combined with niche expansion, such that species compete less with other species
as well as con-specifics.

The combination of 2 animal linkage similarity scenarios crossed with 3 plant
competition scenarios resulted in 6 different versions of a focal community, at
15 levels of plant richness. With 300 replicates for each combination we get
27,000 food-webs overall.

#### Community dynamics

We simulated community dynamics with a bio-energetic model [@delmas2017a;
@gauzens2022]. Changes in the biomass of plants over time are described by the
equation

$$\frac{dB_i}{dt} = (r_iG_i-x_i)B_i - \sum_{j}x_jy_jB_jF_{ij}$$

The first term in equation (1) describes biomass gains through growth, where
$B_i$ is the biomass of species $i$, $r_i$ is the mass-specific maximum growth
rate, $G_i$ is the net growth rate and $x_i$ is the mass-specific metabolic
rate, scaled to the growth rate $r$ of the smallest basal species *in the
regional pool*. The second term describes losses to consumption, where $B_j$ is
the biomass of consumer $j$, $y_j$ is the maximum feeding rate of $j$ relative
to its metabolic rate and $F_{ij}$ is the per unit biomass feeding rate of
species $j$ on species $i$.

The net growth rate of species $i$ is defined as

$$G_i = 1 - \frac{s_i}{K_i}$$

where $K_i$ is the carrying capacity of species $i$. $s_i$ depends on the inter-
and intra-specific competition for resources $a_{ij}$.

$$s_i = \sum_{j}a_{ij}B_j $$

The diagonal elements of matrix $a$ correspond to intra-specific competition
while the off-diagonals to inter-specific competition.

It is by manipulating the relative strengths of the $a_{ij}$ elements that we
implemented the different plant competition scenarios described above. While
restricting row sums to 1, we set $\sum_j a_{ij} \leq a_{ii}$ for the baseline
scenario, $\sum_j a_{ij} << a_{ii}$ for the shift to higher intra-specific
competition. Finally, combining the $a_{ii}$ values of the former scenario with
the $a_{ij}$ values of the later scenario, we produced communities with an
overall decrease in plant competition. In all cases the $a$ matrix was
multiplied by $N$ (number of plant species in the community) such that the
overall competition experienced by one species would sum to $N$ for the first
two competition scenarios, or to a fraction of $N$ for the reduced competition
scenario.

Changes in the biomass of animals over time are described by the equation

$$\frac{dB_i}{dt} = B_i(x_iy_i\sum_{j}F_{ji}e_{j} - x_i) - \sum_{j}x_jy_jB_jF_{ij}$$

The first term in equation () describes biomass gains through consumption (after
metabolic losses) where $B_i$ is the biomass of species $i$, $F_{ji}$ is the per
unit biomass feeding rate of species $i$ on species $j$, $e_j$ is the
assimilation efficiency of prey $j$. The second term describes losses to
consumption as in eq. 1.

The multi-prey (for $k$ prey species) functional response $F_{ij}$ of species
$j$ consuming $i$ is described by the equation

$$F_{ij} = \frac{w_{ij}B_i^q}{B_0^q + c_jB_j + \sum_kw_{kj}B_k^q}$$

where $w_{ij}$ is $j$'s relative consumption rate when consuming $i$. $q$ is the
Hill exponent determining the shape of the functional response. $B_0$ is the
half-saturation density while $c_j$ is the intra-specific consumer interference
factor.

We simulated community dynamics using the *ATNr* package [@gauzens2022]. We run
simulations for 40,000 time-steps (most communities reached equilibrium at
\~30,000 time-steps).

#### Ecosystem functioning

To assess the effects of competition changes among animals and plants on
ecosystem functioning, we examined the standing plant biomass at the end of
simulations, as well as plant primary productivity (the first term in equation
1). Herbivory pressure on plants was quantified as the total out-flux of energy
(second term in equation 1) from plants to their consumers (including omnivores)
per unit of plant biomass. Finally, we quantified the control of herbivores by
predators as the ratio of out-fluxes over in-fluxes to herbivores [after
@barnes2020].

We present the relationship between plant richness and each ecosystem function
in communities "without history" (i.e. unrestricted linkage similarity among
animals and high inter- as well as intra-specific competition among plants) as a
baseline and then ~~we consider the difference in function from that baseline as
the result of the changes in plant or animal competition~~.

### Results

~~Out of 24000 simulated communities, 516 (2.15%) had no plant species surviving
at the end of simulated dynamics and were discarded~~. Communities with a high
initial plant richness had on average a larger proportion of plant and animal
species surviving at the end of simulations (supplement?). This resulted in a
positive plant richness - animal richness relationship.

productivity, (b) herbivore control by predators and (c) herbivory pressure on

(red) or when overall competition is low (green); for animals, when trophic
niche similarity is unrestricted (solid) or when trophic niche similarity is
reduced (dashed). Note that the three sub-figures have dissimilar y
axes.](images/figure2.png)

The simulated communities reproduced the expected positive and saturating plant
richness-productivity relationship (fig. 2a), as well as a positive relationship
between richness and standing plant biomass (figSA). Control of herbivores had a
hump-shaped relationship with plant richness reaching a peak in communities with
between 4 and 8 plant species (fig 2b). Similarly, herbivory pressure on plants
peaked in communities with \~4 plant species and declined with increasing plant
richness (fig 2c).

A comparison of the different competition scenarios across all simulated
communities, revealed that plant communities with stronger intra-specific
competition had reduced productivity despite the release from inter-specific
competition, which resulted in a dampening of the richness-productivity
relationship (fig.2a red lines vs yellow). A combined reduction of inter- and
intra-specific competition reproduced the observed pattern of a steeper
diversity productivity relationship (fig.2a green lines vs yellow). Communities
with low animal competition/high consumer complementarity had on average higher
productivity than communities with high animal competition/low consumer
complementarity but this difference was more pronounced in communities with low
plant competition (fig.2a dashed lines vs solid).

The effect of competition differences on herbivore control were qualitatively
similar; higher intraspecific competition among plants had a negative effect on
herbivore control (fig.2b red lines vs yellow), while the effect of lower plant
competition was positive (fig.2b green lines vs yellow). High consumer
complementarity had a positive effect on herbivore control regardless of the
plant competition scenario (fig.2b dashed lines vs solid).

Herbivory pressure on plants was not strongly affected by an increase of plant
intra-specific competition, but it increased with lower plant competition,
especially in communitites with high plant richness. Communities with high
consumer complementarity had lower herbivory pressure and additionally this
dampened any effects of plant competition.

To better appreciate how changes in plant and animal competition over time
affect ecosystem functioning, we need to consider these differences not across
all simulated communities but within each community, under different competition
scenarios, i.e. what is the difference in function of a focal community, as it
transitions from high to low plant competition; what is the additional
difference as an effect of increased consumer complementarity etc. In figure 3
we present these differences in productivity (a), herbivory control (b) and
herbivory pressure (c), across the plant richness gradient, for communities that
transition to higher intraspecific plant competition (i) or lower plant
competition (iii) and then the additional difference as those transition to
higher consumer complementarity (ii and iv respectively). While the effects of
competition changes "over time" are qualitatively similar to what is shown in
figure 2, a direct examination of the differences in function highlights a few
important points. Specifically, it is clear that changes in plant competition
have a consistent effect on productivity, especially at higher richness levels
(negative for increased intraspecific competition, positive for lower
competition). In contrast, the average effect of an increase in animal
complementarity on primary productivity may be positive, especially when
combined with low plant competition but there is considerable variability, with
a lot of communities experiencing a reduction of productivity. The increase of
animal complementarity has similarly variable effects on the difference over
time of the other two ecosystem functions, while the reduction of plant
competition has similarly consistent effects on them.

~~When comparing our scenarios of competition change to a baseline of
unrestricted similarity among animals and high inter-specific as well as
intra-specific competition among plants (fig. 1a), we found that a reduction of
similarity (and therefore competition) among animals had a marginally positive
practically no effect in the richness-productivity relationship (fig1b) (but had
a more pronounced positive effect on the richness-biomass relationship
(fig.SAb)).~~

~~Changes in plant competition had generally stronger effects. When the change
in competition resulted in plant species competing less with other species but
stronger with con-specifics, there was on average a negative effect on the
richness-productivity relationship across all richness levels (although the
effect was variable at low plant richness and very consistent at high plant
richness) (fig. 1c). By contrast, lowering competition overall in the plant
community led to a consistent relative increase in productivity at higher
richness levels (fig. 1d), corresponding to a steepening of the
richness-diversity slope.~~

~~Finally, the combination of reduced animal and plant competition had on
average a positive difference in productivity that was larger at higher plant
richness (fig. 1e). Additionally, the difference in productivity of communities
with low versus high animal competition when plant competition is low (fig. SB),
shows that the reduction in animal competition does have a small contribution to
the relationship shown in fig.1e.~~

$~$

~~The pressure of herbivory on plants (quantified as total out-fluxes from
plants to their consumers, including omnivores, divided by plant biomass) was
lower at higher richness levels (fig2). The difference in herbivory pressure as
a result of changes in animal or plant competition was highly variable at low
plant richness and diminished at high richness but, overall, competition changes
did not have an effect on the slope or intercept of the
richness-herbivory-pressure relationship (figs 2b-d).~~

~~The control of herbivores by predators (quantified as the ratio of out-fluxes
to in-fluxes of herbivores) had a hump-shaped relationship with plant richness
(fig.3). This was largely the result of no control at the lowest richness level
as a majority of the 2 plant species communities consisted of plants and
herbivores alone with no higher levels surviving. A reduction in animal
competition resulted in a relative increase in herbivory-control on average,
that was more pronounced at intermediate richness levels (fig. 3b). A shift of
plant competition towards stronger intra-specific competition had the opposite
effect (fig. 3c), corresponding to a dampening of the hump-shaped relationship.
Conversely, lower plant competition resulted in a positive difference in
herbivore-control at higher plant richness (fig. 3d). Finally the combined
change of lower animal and plant competition, also had a positive difference in
herbivore control at higher plant richness. Again the contribution of a
reduction of animal competition is clear when comparing the differene in
herbivore control among communities with low versus high animal competition when
plant competition is low (fig. SC).~~

(c) herbivory pressure across the plant richness gradient as the result of a
community transitioning from one competition scenario to another: from high
inter and intraspecific plant competition (i) to lower inter- but higher
intraspecific plant competition or (iii) to lower overall plant competition and

increases (ii) in communities with low inter- but high intraspecific plant
competition, or (iv) in communities with low overall plant
competition.](images/deltas-02.png)

### Discussion

[in the fullness of time]

Our results demonstrate that changes in ecosystem function as communities change
over time largely depend on the exact change in plant species niches and how
this will in turn affect plant competition. If plants respond to inter-specific
competition by restricting their niche, thereby experiencing stronger
competition by conspecifics, the effect of change over time would be negative.
If on the other hand plants have the potential to avoid inter-specific
competition by spreading out in niche-space, thereby maintaining low levels of
intra-specific competition, the effect on productivity can be positive. Our
results therefore provide a mechanism in support of empirical evidence that
intra-specific variation can be as important as species diversity for some
ecosystem processes [@crutsinger2006; @desroches2018].

As a simplifying assumption, we configured plant competition change over time in
a way that implies that the plants' potential of niche expansion is
unconstrained by the number of plant species. In reality, the capacity of
species to avoid overlapping inside a finite niche space will be constrained by
the filling of the niche space and therefore by the number of coexisting
species. The complexity of the niche space (number of dimensions) can also
determine how an increase in species will impact the potential to avoid
competition but regardless of the number of ways that species can differ from
one another, ultimately an increase in richness will saturate the niche space.
The implication is that our two different scenarios of plant competition-change
over time can be seen as two extremes and where exactly natural communities
would fall along this continuum would strongly depend on the number of competing
species.

Another aspect of plant resource competition that deserves further
investigation, is that of species being clustered in trait space due to shared
phylogeny or convergence. Species that belong to the same functional group (such
as grasses, or legumes) would compete stronger with each other than with species
in other groups. Individuals in natural communities exist in a competition
gradient, experiencing strong competition from conspecifics, intermediate
competition from individuals of functionally similar species and low competition
from functionally dissimilar species. One important consequence is that the
balance of inter- to intraspecific competition will be determined by the
functional composition of the community.

We do not explicitly consider asymmetric competition, therefore leaving aside
the question of selection effects on function [@loreau2001]. However there is a
lot of evidence that complementarity rather than selection is the driving force
behind the diversity-ecosystem functioning relationship [@loreau2001;
@cardinale2007; @huang2018; but see @genung2020]. Accordingly, our modeling
framework focuses on how increased complementarity among plants and animals can
change the ecosystem functioning relationship.

@seabloom2017 demonstrated experimentally that when plant communities are
embedded in a complex food-web, due to the partial transformation of plant
biomass to animal biomass, the effects of plant richness on productivity can be
obscured, if biomass is used as a proxy for productivity. In contrast, dynamic
models allow us to consider productivity per se, as biomass gain before losses
to consumption, while at the same time examining potential top-down effects of
the animal community. Our results show that in fact the effect of richness on
productivity is stronger when animals as well as plants have complementary
niches. Notably, the magnitude of the effect of animal complementarity on the
difference in productivity seems to be context dependent, as it is less
pronounced in the presence of high plant competition.

In our simulated food-webs, control of herbivores by predators increased sharply
from communities with 2 plant species to those with 4-6 plant species and then
decreased gradually. This is at odds with empirical results suggesting that
increased plant richness leads to a trophic shift towards a higher predator
proportion among consumers [@haddad2009], and increased herbivore control
[@barnes2020]. However this discrepancy is hardly surprising, since the
mechanistic foundation of the "enemies" hypothesis [@root1973] is that diverse
plant communities provide more niches for predators through structural
heterogeneity [@staab2020; @russell1989], an aspect that cannot be captured by
our model. Accordingly, there is evidence that bottom-up effects of plant
diversity tend to dampen at higher trophic levels [@scherber2010].

Regardless of the exact shape of the plant richness - herbivore control
relationship, our results confirm that higher complementarity among consumers
leads to better control of herbivory, on average. On the other hand, the effect
of higher complementarity among plant species on herbivore control is again
conditional on how this complementarity is achieved, as an increase of
intraspecific competition weakens herbivore control.

Disturbance can impede the progress to mature, structured communities of high
complementarity; indeed consumers in disturbed habitats can have poor niche
specialization [@korotkevich2018], suggesting that disturbance can have a
regressive effect, preventing communities to transition to [aaaaarghhh].

In natural communities, increased productivity can have a bottom-up effect on
consumer complementarity even in the absence of species replacement, as
increased resource availability allows consumers to subsist on a narrower diet
[@lesser2020].

![Figure SA. Standing plant biomass at equilibrium. (a) Standing plant biomass
at different levels of initial plant richness for communities with unrestricted
animal similarity and high interspecific plant competition (a). The difference
in biomass relative to (a) when animals are less similar to each other (b), when
plants compete less with other species but stronger with conspecifics (c), when
plants compete less overall (d), b & d combined (e). Black points are mean
values, thick black lines represent the 75% density interval, thin black lines
the 95% density interval.](images/plantbiomass3.png)
